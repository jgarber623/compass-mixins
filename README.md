# Compass Mixins #

This repository is a collection of frequently-used mixins written in SCSS to be used in conjunction with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)-based projects.


## Using these mixins

You can incorporate these mixins into your project in a number of ways.

**The first—and easiest—method** is to simply copy the contents of the various mixins into your stylesheet.

You could also **grab the desired mixin files**, add them to your own project (or `mixins` folder), and include _those_ files in your stylesheet. For this method, I prefer using the excellent [sass-globbing gem](https://github.com/chriseppstein/sass-globbing).

Finally, you could get really fancy and set this repository up as a [Git submodule](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules). That'd be a real [power move](http://www.zefrank.com/thewiki/Power_Move).
